Write a insertion sort method that sorts from least to greatest.
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
Present a complete set of working tests
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

If array has at least one element then it will run. It checks the 2 value and compares it to the first and places it from least to greatest for all the values to the left. It then iterates over the array doing the same for each element. The BigO for time is quadratic and for space is constant.
