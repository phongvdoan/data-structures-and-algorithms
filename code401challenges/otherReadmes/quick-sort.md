# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

[Code](/code401challenges/src/main/java/code401challenges/quickSort/QuickSort.java)

Write a quick sort method that sorts from least to greatest using recursion.
## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
Present a complete set of working tests
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

If array has one or none element then it will return the array with no changes. If it is greater than 1 then the recursive function will sort by the pivot. BigO for time is O(n log n) and for space is O(1)
